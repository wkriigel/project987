elegant Meteor Grey Metallic over a Stone Grey leather interior. With an original MSRP of $64,765 and a thoughtfully chosen set of options, it represents the perfect blend of performance, style, and everyday usability. At its heart is a 3.4-liter flat-six engine producing 310 horsepower, paired with Porsches 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. This drivetrain delivers lightning-fast shifts and a 060 mph time under five seconds, while the mid-engine balance and precise steering make the Boxster S one of the most rewarding cars to drive in its class. This example comes well-equipped with heated seats, Bluetooth connectivity, universal audio interface, and storage box for added convenience. The wind deflector enhances top-down comfort, while floor mats in interior color and premium Stone Grey leather create a refined cabin atmosphere. On the outside, it features striking 19-inch Carrera S II wheels with Porsche-crested wheel centers, and bi-xenon lighting for enhanced visibility. The body and interior are both in excellent condition. A touch screen radio with back up camera has also been installed. This is a truly stunning hard to find example that is ready to be enjoyed!

EXTRA CLEAN!!! This 2010 Porsche Boxster is in great shape. It's well equipped with a Power Convertible Top, 7 Speed PDK Transmission, Heated Leather Seats, Bose Surround Sound System, Bluetooth, Automatic Headlights, 18 Cayman S Wheels and many more luxury features. The paint and body are in excellent condition. It's originally from California, then the previous owner moved to Michigan where it was garage kept and stored in the winter. The Carfax shows minor damage reported. It was scratched in a wind storm and has been properly repaired. The black leather interior is like new! The seats look great. Even the convertible top is in excellent condition. The 18 Cayman S wheels look great and the Continental tires have plenty of tread remaining. Everything is in proper working order and all services are up to date. The top works great and the AC blows ice cold. Boxster's are fun cars and this one is in really good condition.
