Cayman R
November 13, 2019
By FlatSixhead from Oak Brook, IL
Owns this car

The Cayman R is amazing on all levels. The R handles like a race car but is soft enough for the street. The mid-engine configuration (which is also leveraged by the factory Porsche race team for their GTLM entries) is superior. This car will be a collectable very soon as only 461 made it to the US.

Most exciting and beautiful car to own
August 5, 2017

Owns this car

Never though I could feel this way. I found a perfect traveling companion, always eager to please, gives unerringly whenever asked and does so unfailingly. Easy on the eye, passers by stare at her beauty. Graced with power, intelligence and a commanding presence with a softness within that belies her strength. Cayman S. Mine forever!

Awesome ride

Owns this car

This is by far the best handling car I've ever had. It's really quick and looks amazing. The sports option is worth the extra money.
