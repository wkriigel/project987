Cayman R
The Cayman R is amazing on all levels. The R handles like a race car but is soft enough for the street. The mid-engine configuration (which is also leveraged by the factory Porsche race team for their GTLM entries) is superior. This car will be a collectable very soon as only 461 made it to the US.

Most exciting and beautiful car to own
Never though I could feel this way. I found a perfect traveling companion, always eager to please, gives unerringly whenever asked and does so unfailingly. Easy on the eye, passers by stare at her beauty. Graced with power, intelligence and a commanding presence with a softness within that belies her strength. Cayman S. Mine forever!

Awesome ride
This is by far the best handling car I've ever had. It's really quick and looks amazing. The sports option is worth the extra money.

Most protective car I've drove
It made me feel safe and special because its the most smoothed driven car I ever had, and all of my family loved the car and was excited I purchased it.
