elegant Meteor Grey Metallic over a Stone Grey leather interior. With an original MSRP of $64,765 and a thoughtfully chosen set of options, it represents the perfect blend of performance, style, and everyday usability. At its heart is a 3.4-liter flat-six engine producing 310 horsepower, paired with Porsches 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. This drivetrain delivers lightning-fast shifts and a 060 mph time under five seconds, while the mid-engine balance and precise steering make the Boxster S one of the most rewarding cars to drive in its class. This example comes well-equipped with heated seats, Bluetooth connectivity, universal audio interface, and storage box for added convenience. The wind deflector enhances top-down comfort, while floor mats in interior color and premium Stone Grey leather create a refined cabin atmosphere. On the outside, it features striking 19-inch Carrera S II wheels with Porsche-crested wheel centers, and bi-xenon lighting for enhanced visibility. The body and interior are both in excellent condition. A touch screen radio with back up camera has also been installed. This is a truly stunning hard to find example that is ready to be enjoyed!

The standard equipment list on both models includes such features as leather-trimmed seats with power recline; a leather-covered steering wheel, gearshift knob, armrests and handbrake handle; a seven-speaker CD stereo; and a power top. Optional equipment includes items like full leather power seating, automatic climate control, a Bose digital sound system, bi-HID headlights, rear parking assist, a three-piece wind deflector, heated seats, a navigation system and a removable aluminum hardtop. Porsche's active suspension management system is also optional on both models, and ordering it specifies a 10mm lower ride height. The standard Boxster comes with 17-inch wheels, while the S wears 18-inch wheels; 19s are optional on both. Side airbags, traction control and four-wheel antilock disc brakes are standard on all Boxsters.""}}",,

The Porsche Boxster, introduced in 1996, helped re-establish Porsche's reputation for building lightweight, mid-engined sports cars. By the time the 2005 model year arrived, the second-generation Boxster (987) brought refinements in performance, handling, and luxury. The 2.7-liter flat-six engine offered a thrilling driving experience, while the mid-engine layout ensured excellent balance and cornering ability. Modern conveniences and increased reliability made the 2005 Boxster an excellent choice for enthusiasts seeking Porsche performance without compromise.
