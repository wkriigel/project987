elegant Meteor Grey Metallic over a Stone Grey leather interior. With an original MSRP of $64,765 and a thoughtfully chosen set of options, it represents the perfect blend of performance, style, and everyday usability. At its heart is a 3.4-liter flat-six engine producing 310 horsepower, paired with Porsches 7-speed PDK dual-clutch transmission. This drivetrain delivers lightning-fast shifts and a 060 mph time under five seconds, while the mid-engine balance and precise steering make the Boxster S one of the most rewarding cars to drive in its class. This example comes well-equipped with heated seats, Bluetooth connectivity, universal audio interface, and storage box for added convenience. The wind deflector enhances top-down comfort, while floor mats in interior color and premium Stone Grey leather create a refined cabin atmosphere. On the outside, it features striking 19-inch Carrera S II wheels with Porsche-crested wheel centers, and bi-xenon lighting for enhanced visibility. The body and interior are both in excellent condition. A touch screen radio with back up camera has also been installed. This is a truly stunning hard to find example that is ready to be enjoyed!

It's well equipped with a Power Convertible Top, 7 Speed PDK Transmission, Heated Leather Seats, Bose Surround Sound System, Bluetooth, Automatic Headlights, 18 Cayman S Wheels and many more luxury features.
