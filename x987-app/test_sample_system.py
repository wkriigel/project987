"""
Test script for the new sample extraction and testing system

PROVIDES: Testing of sample extraction and testing system
DEPENDS: Sample extractor and tester modules
CONSUMED BY: Development and testing
CONTRACT: Tests sample extraction and testing functionality
TECH CHOICE: Sample-based testing for scraping validation
RISK: Low - test files don't affect production code

This script demonstrates how to:
1. Extract samples from different sources
2. Test scraping techniques against samples
3. Generate recommendations for improvement
