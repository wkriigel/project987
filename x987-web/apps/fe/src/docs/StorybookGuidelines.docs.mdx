# Storybook Guidelines

This guide defines how we write, organize, and maintain stories to ensure consistent, accessible, and useful documentation across the x987 design system and app UI.

## Structure & Naming

- Use a clear hierarchy via `title`:
  - `UI/Chips/Chip`, and nest derived components under it: `UI/Chips/Chip/ThresholdChip`, `UI/Chips/Chip/PaintChip`
  - `Inputs/Filters/FilterSelect`
  - `Guides/...` for process documentation (this page)
- Prefer nouns for groups and components (e.g., `UI/Chips/Chip`).
- Keep story names short and state-focused: `Small`, `Disabled`, `FullWidth`.

### Indicating inheritance/extension

- Place variants that extend a base under the base’s path.
- Example: `ThresholdChip` and `PaintChip` extend `Chip` → `UI/Chips/Chip/ThresholdChip` and `UI/Chips/Chip/PaintChip`.
- Also list variants as `subcomponents` on the base’s meta so docs show related APIs on the same page.

## Story Basics

- Each component has at least:
  - A basic state (Default or Small)
  - A disabled/unavailable state (if applicable)
  - Edge case or expanded state (e.g., ManyOptions)
- Use `args` and Controls to demonstrate props; avoid custom renders unless necessary.
- Favor small, focused stories vs. one giant example.

## Theming & Layout

- All stories render with global Tailwind + Ant Design reset via preview config.
- Use minimal wrapper styling for contrast (e.g., a padded container) when needed.
- Do not hardcode brand colors in components; use tokens from `roles`.

## Accessibility

- Label interactive controls (Selects, Inputs) with a visible label prop.
- Ensure hit targets are large enough and keyboard focus is usable (AntD defaults suffice).
- Prefer semantic HTML via AntD components and proper `aria-*` from the library.

## Quality & Testing

- Cover primary states and props so maintainers can visually validate common cases.
- Keep stories deterministic: mock data inline, no network calls.
- If adding interactive logic, consider a `play` function for deterministic checks (optional).

## Documentation Pages

- Use `.docs.mdx` or `.stories.mdx` for component-specific guidance, API notes, or usage patterns.
- Keep examples copy‑paste friendly; prefer typed snippets with minimal external dependencies.

## When to Create a New Group

- If a component doesn’t conceptually fit an existing area (e.g., a new filter type), create a group:
  - Example: `Inputs/Filters/ModelSelect` (future), separate from `UI/Chips/*`.
